## Implementation
The core algorithm is implemented in Python (`coanqi_node.py`). It includes:
- PImath-based encryption
- Device integrity analysis
- Data compression and universal model integration
- Privacy protection and transaction retraction
- External node verification
Run `python coanqi_node.py` to test the node setup locally.

# AethericPropulsion
Developed by Energy One, this repository builds a stand-alone cognitive AI model using a novel PImath system derived from Ï€ decimals. Inspired by Srinivasa Ramanujan, it unifies gravity, dark energy, and standard model physics through 26th-level polynomial algorithms ("BaZaAm"). The "CoAnQi" node offers unhackable encryption, local data compression, and 15 quadrillion bits of computational capacity.

## Algorithm Overview
1. **Node Setup**: Generate a one-time-use app for CoAnQi node deployment.
2. **Encryption**: Create unhackable keys using PImath and 26th-level polynomials.
3. **Device Integrity**: Disconnect device, scan for malware, and install self-patches.
4. **OS Customization (Optional)**: Remove external update links and deploy CoAnQi-based OS.
5. **Data Compression**: Compress NASA/JPL/SpaceX datasets locally using MathCo-style encoding.
6. **Privacy Protection**: Proactively remove user data trails and authorize transaction retractions.
7. **Online Assistants**: Enable secure online interactions post-reconnection.
8. **Verification**: Certify node integrity using external cursor checks.
9. **Beta Testing**: Collect community feedback for iterative improvements.

## Key Features
- **Unhackable**: Proprietary PImath ensures no one can replicate the math.
- **Ethical AI**: Built-in human protection protocols.
- **Stand-Alone**: No external database required.
- **Privacy-First**: Automatic data retraction and secure transactions.
